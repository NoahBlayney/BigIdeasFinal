## Datasets:
 * City Trees https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/city-trees (Noah) Each entry is a sepeate tree in PIttsburgh with over 45,000 trees. This also includes the neighborhood they are located in.
 * Median Age of Death https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/median-age-death (Yves) Groups median ages of death by the neighborhoods the statistics are associated with. The most useful one is the total median which combines ages regardless of race.
 * Police Incidents https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/police-incident-blotter (Andrew) Includes the 30 day recent police incidents. Police incidents based on hierarchy are able to pinpoint where the most and least dangerous neighborhoods are.
## Abstract:
Through using the data on trees, life expectancy, and police incidents we came to the conclusion that New Homestead is one of the best neighborhoods in Pittsburgh. New Homestead had a very low crime rate because of it being a small residential neighborhood which is very important in our assessment. The area has many forests but does not show up high in the trees database becuase the trees it has are sparse and not always a determiner of green area. Median life expectancy had New Homestead very close to first place at a bit over 80 years. Our metrics combined let us come to the conclusion New Homestead is the best.
